/**
 * The result of a sample on a JMX server.

 * It's a hack as it contains not only the results but also some other data like
 * the path to the file where to save the graph. the reason for that is that the
 * file name (and the saveGraph flag) must be set in the sampler to be
 * persisted. they are passed to the visualiser via this result object.
