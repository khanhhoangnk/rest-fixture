RestFixture: A FitNesse fixture for testing REST services
=========================================================

The RestFixture is a FitNesse (http://fitnesse.org)  fixture that allows 
developers and/or product owners to write test fixtures for REST services
with simplicity in mind. The idea is to write tests that are self 
documenting and easy to write and read, without the need to write Java code.

The fixture allows test writers to express tests as actions (any of the 
allowed HTTP methods) to operate on resource URIs and express expectations on 
the content of the return code, headers and body. All without writing one 
single line of Java code.

And it also works as a living/executable documentation of the API.
